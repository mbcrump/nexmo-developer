# Create your Vonage application

You now need to create a Vonage [Application](/conversation/concepts/application). You will do so with the NeRu CLI.

**1.** Create your project directory if you've not already done so, run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
mkdir neru-test-app
```

**2.** Change into the project directory.

```sh
cd neru-test-app
```

**3.** Create a Vonage application.

```sh
neru app create --name "Test app"
```
