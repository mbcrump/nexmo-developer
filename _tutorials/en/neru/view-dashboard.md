# View the NeRu Dashboard

To take a deeper look at your project and deployments you can use the [NeRu dashboard](https://dashboard.serverless.vonage.com/).

You can click on your deployed instance which will give you access to logs, events, your instance's configuration, and deployment history. 

For example opening the config tab will show the configuration for this instance, matching what you added in the neru.yml file earlier:

Then clicking on the history tab will show you the history of deploys for this instance:
