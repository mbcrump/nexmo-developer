# NeRu Debugging

NeRu allows you to debug your code locally on your machine as if it was deployed on the NeRu platform. It works by starting a remote debug server that proxies requests to your machine. Since is it local debugging, you can use your IDE to attach a debugger, set breakpoints and run through the execution of your project line by line. 

## Debugger Dependencies

* Node.JS: You will need to install a file watcher, for example, [`nodemon`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) globally:

    ```sh
    npm install -g nodemon
    ```

## Start a Debug Session

Edit your configuration file (`neru.yml`) to add an entrypoint for debug under a root level `debug`:

```yaml
project:
    name: project
instance:
    ...
debug:
    name: debugger
    entrypoint: [nodemon, --inspect, index.js]
```

Run the debug start command from in terminal session in your project directory. Note that the first time you run this it will set up and install a few more things:

```sh
neru debug 
```

This will start the server, once done you can start using your application. The debugger will will show any incoming and outgoing requests. Code changes you make and save will trigger the debugger to reload automatically.

## Debug from VSCode

Using VSCode you can attach a debugger to the server to allow you to set breakpoints and step through your code. To do so click on the *Run and Debug* button, then *create a `launch.json` file*. Select `nodejs` as a preset:

In the `launch.json` file replace the entire contents of the file with the following:

```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "type": "node",
            "request": "attach",
            "name": "Attach Neru Debugger",
            "port": 9229,
            "restart": true,
            "localRoot": "${workspaceFolder}",
        }
    ]
}
```

This will configure the VSCode debugger to work with the NeRu debug server. The debug server is running on port 9229, so if you are using a different program to debug, attach to this port. Start your debug server if you have not already with `neru debug`, then click on the *start debugging* button to attach the VSCode debugger:

Once attached you will have access to the debug controls.

### Breakpoints

By clicking to the left of a line number you can set a breakpoint in your code, so the program will pause on this line and allow you inspect the program, step over and so on:

When your breakpoint is hit, VSCode will highlight the line that it has stopped on, and using the debug console you can print out values from your program:

Or you can use the debug controls to inspect your even deeper by stepping in and out of functions, or continuing past the current line.
